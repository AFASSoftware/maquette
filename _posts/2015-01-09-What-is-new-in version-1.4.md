The project has a new name, "maquette". Furthermore, the following features have been added:

- support for CSS transitions
- DOM attributes are now used instead of properties based on the vnode property value type. Strings becomes attributes, the rest properties.
- Transitions of vnode property changes, including classnames, is now possible.
