Maquette has not been standing still in the past month, on the contrary. 
We released a new minor version, 1.6 which contains a better animations API.
VelocityJS animations now work without any magic exactly the way is described on the [velocityJS page](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) (see the without JQuery section).
We also added the much needed documentation about [how animations work](http://maquettejs.org/docs/animations.html).
We added live code editors on this page so you can quickly try things out yourself. Have fun!
