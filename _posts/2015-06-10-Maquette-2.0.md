title: Maquette 2.0
---

Since launching maquette, we have found a couple of opportunities to improve the API.
Therefore, we thought it wise to make a 2.0 release. 

The biggest change is that we changed the Projector to handle multiple projections at once.
The creation of the DOM now happens immediately, instead of on the first requestAnimationFrame. 
This makes the projector easier to understand.

Other improvements include improvements of method names.

We do not expect people to have difficulties upgrading from maquette 1.0.
