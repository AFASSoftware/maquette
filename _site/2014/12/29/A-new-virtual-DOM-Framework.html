<p>There are many virtual DOM frameworks to choose from already. 
React is widely used, Mithril is very good, many others look promising as well. 
Still, the framework I have in mind does not yet exist.</p>

<p>First of all, I like animated transitions. AngularJS style, like Reactâ€™s CSSTransitionGroup.
Second, I want a lightweight framework. With lightweight I mean: Fast, easy to learn, easy to debug
and predictable.</p>

<p>So React is too heavyweight and Mithril does not really have animated transitions. 
I know animated transitions can be added in Mithril, but I do not want to clutter up my code like that.</p>

<p>So I decided to build my own virtual DOM framework. How hard can it be?
So focussing on animated transitions first, I realized that there would be disappearing 
elements in the real DOM that are no longer part of the virtual DOM. These DOM nodes should
be left alone. This is why I settled on the following implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make the animation strategy pluggable thus allowing both velocityJS and CSS Transitions.</li>
  <li>Keep a reference to the rendered DOM node on virtual DOM nodes.</li>
  <li>Diffing and patching is done simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Virtual DOM nodes are considered immutable. This allows a powerful caching mechanism based on comparing object identity. </li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping a reference to the rendered DOM on virtual DOM nodes is what makes maquette really different from other implementations.
I look forward to seeing what the performance implications of this decision are and what other possibilities this enables
like progressive enhancement.</p>
