    <h1>Conditional CSS classes</h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations on completing the tutorial this far! We still need to explain two more concepts before you are ready to build maquette applications yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first concept is about conditional CSS classes.
      You are already familliar with css classes in the selector. For example
      <code>"div.landscape"</code> creates a <code>&lt;div class="landscape"&gt;</code>.
      But what if our landscape div can also have a CSS class "night" which is conditional?
      This usecase is so common, that maquette provides a special construction for this.
      It uses the <code>classes</code> property, which is an object literal mapping classnames to a condition.
      It works as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>h("div.landscape", {
  classes: { night: new Date().getHours() &lt;= 8 }        
})</pre>
    <p>
      Looks easy right? Your next assignment is to assign the CSS class 'stealth' to the
      flying saucer, based on the 'stealth' variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck!
