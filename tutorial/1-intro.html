    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <p>
      In this tutorial we will make you familliar with the virtual DOM technique and the maquette library.
      The application we are building in this tutorial is a simulator for css transitions. More specifically, we are going to make a remote control for a flying saucer.
      This tutorial is made for people who are familiar with HTML and Javascript.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Get started
    </h2>
    <p>
      In this first exercise you will create the flying saucer we are going to control.
      Thanks to some alien piece of CSS, the flying saucer only needs the following markup: &lt;div class="saucer"&gt;
      In maquette, the browser DOM is not created from HTML however, but from a notation called 'virtual hyperscript'.
      It is different from HTML in two important ways.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a template language, which means it combines data with markup.</li>
      <li>It is plain Javascript, which means it runs very fast.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The `h()` function in virtual hyperscript is responsible for creating the DOM.
      The first parameter of this function is a CSS selector string, like "div.landscape", which results in a &lt;div class="landscape"&gt;.
      The last parameter is an array of contents, text strings and other nodes.
    </p>
