The last concept that we are going to explain in this tutorial is the distinguishable rule.

As you may already know, the maquette library is optimized for speed. 
It is also able to animate transitions.
To make this work, maquette requires you to obide by one simple rule.
You must make sure that all childnodes of a node are distinguishable.
This is usually not as hard as it looks.
Nodes are already distinguishable if they have a different selector. 
If two childnodes have the same selector, they must have a 'key' attribute 
that is unique among the childnodes. This is usually a database-id or an index number.

Here is one quick example (Documentation about the javascript map() function can be found here):

h("ul), [
  items.map(function(item) {
    return h("li", {key: item.id}, [item.text]);
  })
])

For your next assignment, we have already added the stealth checkbox to the remote control.
The application gives crashes right now. It is your task to make the application work. Good luck.
