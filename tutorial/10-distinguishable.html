      As you may already know, the maquette library is optimized for speed.
      It is also able to animate transitions.
      To make this work, maquette requires you to obide by one simple rule.
      You must make sure that all childnodes of a node are distinguishable.
      This is usually straightforward. Nodes are already distinguishable if they have a different selector.
      If two childnodes have the same selector, they must have a 'key' attribute that is unique among the childnodes.
      This can be a database-id or an index number.

      Here is one quick example (Documentation about the javascript map() function can
      be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="_blank">here</a>):
    </p>
    <pre>
h("ul", [
  items.map(function(item) {
    return h("li", {key: item.id}, [item.text]);
  })
])
    </pre>

      For your final assignment, we have already added the stealth checkbox to the remote control.
      The application gives crashes right now. It is your task to make the application work. Good luck.
