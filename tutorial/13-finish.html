    <h1>The grande finale</h1>
    <p>
      By now you know everything you need to know about the maquette API.
    </p>
    <p>
      We still want to show you how maquette makes developing a larger web application straightforward.
      In this last exercise you must complete the remote control by adding support for the available CSS transforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will notice we split the code into "components" for you.
      A component in maquette is simply an object which exposes a renderMaquette function.
      The component files are integrated using window globals, but you could also be using requirejs or browserify.
