The first concept is about conditional CSS classes.
You are already familliar with css classes in the selector. For example 
"div.landscape" creates a <div class="landscape">. But what if our landscape
div can also have a CSS class "night" which is conditional?
This usecase is so common, that maquette provides a special construction for this.
It uses the classes property, which is an object literal mapping classnames to a condition.
It works as follows:

h("div.landscape", { night: new Date().getHours() <= 8 })

Quite easy right? Your next assignment is to assign the css class 'stealth' to the
flying saucer, based on the 'stealth' variable.

Good luck!
