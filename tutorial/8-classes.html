    <h1>Conditional CSS classes</h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations on completing the tutorial this far! We still need to explain two more concepts before you are ready to build maquette applications yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first concept is about conditional CSS classes.
      You are already familliar with css classes in the selector. For example
      "div.landscape" creates a &lt;div class="landscape"&gt;.
      But what if our landscape div can also have a CSS class "night" which is conditional?
      This usecase is so common, that maquette provides a special construction for this.
      It uses the classes property, which is an object literal mapping classnames to a condition.
      It works as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>h("div.landscape", { night: new Date().getHours() &lt;= 8 })</pre>
    <p>
      Looks easy right? Your next assignment is to assign the CSS class 'stealth' to the
      flying saucer, based on the 'stealth' variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck!
