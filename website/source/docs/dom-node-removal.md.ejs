### DOM node removal

When virtual DOM nodes are removed, there is normally no need to take any action. But for example when global event listener were added during
creation of the DOM Node, a cleanup action is required. To this end, the `afterRemoved` callback is used.

This callback is called asynchronously during an idle period (using `requestIdleCallback` and falling back to a `setTimeout`).
This means it is possible that an event listener might still be called after the DOM node was actually removed from the DOM but the `afterRemoved` callback
wasn't called yet.

The example below shows how the `afterRemoved` callback can be used.

<%- include('../../partials/live-editor-start.ejs') -%>
var styles = {
  box: {
    margin: '10px 0',
    width: '100px',
    height: '100px',
    backgroundColor: '#f00'
  }
};
var showBox = true;

function doSomething() {
  console.log('doing something');
}

function handleAfterCreateBox(element) {
  element.ownerDocument.addEventListener('mousemove', doSomething);
}

function handleAfterRemovedBox(element) {
  element.ownerDocument.removeEventListener('mousemove', doSomething);
}

function render() {
  return h('div', [
    h('button', { onclick: () => showBox = !showBox }, [
      showBox ? 'Hide box' : 'Show box'
    ]),
    showBox
      ? h('div', {
          styles: styles.box,
          afterCreate: handleAfterCreateBox,
          afterRemoved: handleAfterRemovedBox
        })
      : undefined
  ]);
}

projector.append(domNode, render);
